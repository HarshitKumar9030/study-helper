# Icon File Placeholder
# You should replace this with an actual icon.ico file
# For now, the app will use the default system icon
# To add a custom icon:
# 1. Create or find a 32x32 pixel .ico file
# 2. Name it "icon.ico"
# 3. Place it in the windows folder
# 4. Make sure it's included in the project as Content with "Copy to Output Directory" set to "PreserveNewest"
