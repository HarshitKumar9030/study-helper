# 📚 Study Helper App – Build Plan

## 🚀 What Are You Building?

A smart **Study Helper** program that blends the power of Python for backend intelligence and a modern **Next.js 15** front-end to help students focus, plan, and learn better using **voice recognition**, **smart scheduling**, and **productivity tools**.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend (Server):** Python (compiled into an executable)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js
- **Voice Features:** Python voice libraries (e.g., `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`)
- **App Architecture:**
    
    ```
    /study-helper
    ├── /client   (Next.js frontend)
    └── /server   (Python backend)
    ```

## 🌟 Core Features

### 🎙 Voice Recognition Assistant

- Always-on assistant (like Google Assistant)
- Responds to study-related voice queries
- Logs interactions for performance tracking

### 📅 Smart Study Scheduler

- Learns your study habits
- Creates adaptive and optimized schedules
- Uses voice data + performance logs for tuning

### 🚫 Focus Mode

- Blocks distractions (websites/apps)
- Tracks productivity using voice/activity monitoring
- Controlled via voice commands or web dashboard

### 💬 Smart Chat Assistant

- A chat interface for typed questions
- Helpful for quick queries without voice

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 1. 🔑 Setup Authentication (NextAuth.js)

- First priority: Implement auth in the **Next.js frontend**
- Ensure MongoDB integration with auth
- Plan for shared user sessions across both Python and frontend

### 2. 🐍 Build Python Backend (Executable)

- Create core app logic in Python
- Compile into a platform-compatible executable
- Sync authentication state with NextAuth (possibly using JWT or session tokens)

### 3. 🔄 API Integration & Syncing

- Build an API bridge between Python executable and web app
- Sync voice logs, productivity data, and user activity
- Use secure APIs for two-way communication

### 4. 📊 Dashboard & Data Visualization

- Display logs, schedules, assistant history, and performance
- Add UI for configuring focus mode and assistant settings

### 5. 🎨 Polish the UI

- Finalize front-end design
- Improve UX and visual feedback
- Add markdown help & documentation within the web app

## 📌 Notes & Challenges

- Biggest challenge: **auth syncing** between NextAuth and Python executable
- May need to:
    - Expose a token endpoint in Next.js to be read by Python
    - Use a shared encrypted session or JWT token mechanism
- Should modularize Python functions for future AI/ML extensions

## 🧠 Final Goal

An intelligent, voice-enabled productivity app that understands you and helps you study smarter, not harder.
